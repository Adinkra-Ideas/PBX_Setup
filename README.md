## :loudspeaker:  Introduction
In this Project, I setup a complete business phone system on the https://testpbx.top domain using Crosstalk PBX, and hosted on Vultr Cloud Servers.
The PBX system handles inbound calls intelligently based on time of day, caller input, and availability of staff.

## :oncoming_automobile:  Development Process
Before embarking on setting up the PBX system, I first created a Model Diagram showing a graphical representation of the Tasks.
The Model Diagram is available [here](https://github.com/Adinkra-Ideas/PBX_Setup/blob/main/Docs/Task-Diagram.pdf)
